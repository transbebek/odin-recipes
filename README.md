# Lara's Cuisine (odin-recipes)

### July 18th, 2023
I'm so happy to have figured out some basics of CSS. Although my recipe website doesn't look quite good yet, I'm sure with time, I'll make it much better and also not plagiarize recipes from the internet. I might even ask my mom for some of her recipes to help me populate website content. Anyway, I also figured out composing individual commit messages for each file. It's kind of annoying to do it one by one in the terminal and I've yet to discover or even look for a GUI solution for git. I guess that's it for now.

This was quite an interesting task. I enjoyed picking out recipes and making the layout for them, however, I messed up at the last commit because I simply forgot to add the files before commenting, so the last commit is for the index file instead of the recipes, although I meant it for the recipes. Nevertheless, it was a fun little project and I'm hoping that when I get into CSS, I'll style the shit out of this website and make it look real cute!
